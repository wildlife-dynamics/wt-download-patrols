## Configuration Guide

Once you've added the workflow template, you'll need to configure it for your specific needs. The configuration form is organized into several sections.

### Basic Configuration

These are the essential settings you'll need to configure for every workflow run:

#### 1. Workflow Details
Give your workflow a name and description to help you identify it later.

- **Workflow Name** (required): A descriptive name for this workflow run and the dashboard title
  - Example: `"August 2015 Events"`
- **Workflow Description** (optional): Additional details about this analysis
  - Example: `"Download arrest and snare events for monthly report"`

#### 2. Time Range
Specify the time period for the events you want to download.

- **Timezone**(required): Use the dropdown to select your timezone
- **Since** (required): Use the calendar picker to select the start date and time
  - Example: `12/17/2025, 12:00 AM`
- **Until** (required): Use the calendar picker to select the end date and time
  - Example: `12/18/2025, 12:00 AM`

#### 3. Data Source
Select your EarthRanger connection.

- **Data Source** (required): Choose from your configured data sources
  - Example: Select `mep_dev` from the dropdown

#### 4. Get Event Data
Choose which events and columns to download.

- **Event Types**: Specify which event types to include. You can find them on your earthranger site: https://<your-site>.pamdas.org/admin/activity/eventtype/ and use the value here.
  - Leave empty to download all event types
  - Example: `["arrest_rep", "snare_rep", "poacher_camp_rep"]`
- **Event Columns**: Select the data fields you want
  - Default includes: id, time, event_type, event_category, title, reported_by, created_at, serial_number, is_collection, event_details, geometry
  - Common columns: `id`, `time`, `event_type`, `event_category`, `reported_by`, `serial_number`, `geometry`
  - Include `event_details` if you need additional event-specific information

#### 5. Download Attachments
Control whether to download files attached to events (photos, documents, etc.). All the files will be stored under <output_folder>/attachments/<event_id>

- **Skip Attachment Download**:
  - Check this to skip downloading attachments (default: checked)
  - Uncheck to download all attachments

##### 6. Group Data (Optional)
Organize your data into separate views based on time periods or categories.

- **Group by**: Create separate outputs grouped by:
  - Time: Year, Month, Day of week, Hour, etc.
  - Category: Select a categorical column from your event data (e.g., event_type, event_category). If you're unsure which columns are available, run the workflow once without grouping to see the data, then configure grouping in a subsequent run.

#### 7. Persist Events
Choose how to save your data.

- **Filetypes**: Select one or more output formats
  - **CSV**: Standard spreadsheet format, opens in Excel
  - **GeoParquet**: Efficient format for geospatial data
  - **GPKG**: GeoPackage format, opens in GIS software like QGIS
  - Example: Select both `CSV` and `GeoParquet`
- **Filename Prefix** (optional): Custom prefix for output files. Ecoscope will attach a hash code to keep it unique
  - Default: `"events"`
  - Example: `"events_monthly"` will create files like `events_monthly_abc123.csv`


#### 8. Generate Maps

##### Skip Map Generation
Control whether to create map visualizations.

- **Skip**: Check this to skip map generation
  - Recommended for large datasets to improve performance
  - Default: unchecked (maps will be generated)

### Advanced Configuration

These optional settings provide additional control over your workflow:


#### Process Events

##### Filter Event Relocations
Remove unwanted data points from your results.

- **Bounding Box**: Limit events to a geographic area
  - Default: entire world (-180 to 180 longitude, -90 to 90 latitude)
- **Filter Exact Point Coordinates**: Exclude events at specific coordinates
  - Useful for filtering out test data or GPS outliers
  - Example: `[{"Latitude": 0.0, "Longitude": 0.0}, {"Latitude": 180.0, "Longitude": 90.0}]`

##### Process Columns
Customize which columns appear in your output.

- **Drop Columns**: Remove specific columns you don't need
  - Example: `["icon_id", "url"]`
- **Retain Columns**: Keep only specific columns in a specific order
  - Leave empty to keep all columns
  - Example: `["time", "event_type", "geometry"]`
- **Rename Columns**: Change column names
  - Example: Rename `reported_by` to `reporter`

##### Apply SQL Query
Advanced users can filter or transform data using SQL.

- **Query**: Write a SQL query to filter or modify the data
  - Use `df` as the table name
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM df WHERE event_category = 'security'`
  - Leave empty to skip


#### Map Base Layers
Customize the background maps for your visualizations.

- **Base Maps**: Select one or more base layers
  - Available options: Open Street Map, Roadmap, Satellite, Terrain,  or custom layers with a URL
  - Default: Terrain and Satellite layers
  - The first layer will appear on the bottom

## Running the Workflow

Once you've configured all the settings:

1. **Review your configuration**
   - Double-check your time range, data source, and event types

2. **Save and run**
   - Click the "Submit" and the workflow will show up in "My Workflows" table button in Ecoscope Desktop
   - Click on "Run" and the workflow will begin processing

3. **Monitor progress and wait for completion**
   - You'll see status updates as the workflow runs
   - Processing time depends on:
     - The size of your date range
     - Number of weather stations
     - Number of observations in the system
   - The workflow completes with status "Success" or "Failed"

## Understanding Your Results

After the workflow completes successfully, you'll find your outputs in the designated output folder.

### Data Outputs

Your event data will be saved in the format(s) you selected:
- **File formats**: CSV, GeoParquet, and/or GPKG (based on your selection)
- **Opens in**: Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets (CSV), Python/R (GeoParquet), QGIS/ArcGIS (GPKG)
- **Best for**:
  - CSV: Quick data review and analysis
  - GeoParquet: Large datasets, programmatic analysis
  - GPKG: Spatial analysis in GIS software
- **Contents**: All event data with normalized event details

### Visual Outputs (When Maps are Generated)

If you didn't skip map generation, you'll also receive:

#### Interactive Map
- **Format**: HTML file or embedded in dashboard
- **Features**:
  - Event points plotted at their locations
  - Points colored by event type (different colors for arrests, snares, camps, etc.)
  - Interactive - click on points to see event details
  - Base map layers you selected (satellite, terrain, etc.)
  - Zoom and pan capabilities

### Grouped Outputs

If you configured data grouping:
- You'll receive separate files for each group. Each file contains only the events for that time period or category
- Maps (if generated) will also be separated by group, with each group view selectable in the dashboard

### Attachments (If Downloaded)

If you enabled attachment downloads:
- **Location**: `<output_folder>/attachments/<event_id>/`
- **Organization**: Each event's attachments stored in its own folder
- **File types**: Photos (JPG, PNG), documents (PDF), or other files uploaded to EarthRanger
- **Naming**: Original filenames preserved

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Workflow fails to start
**Problem**: The workflow won't run or immediately fails

**Solutions**:
- Verify your EarthRanger data source is properly configured
- Check that you have network connectivity to the EarthRanger server
- Ensure your credentials haven't expired
- Confirm the data source name matches exactly.

#### No events returned
**Problem**: Workflow completes but produces empty results

**Solutions**:
- Verify the date range is correct (start date should be before end date)
- Check that the event types you specified actually exist in your EarthRanger system. Make sure you are using `VALUE`, not `DISPLAY`
- Visit `https://<your-site>.pamdas.org/admin/activity/eventtype/` to confirm event type names
- Remove any filters temporarily to see if they're excluding all data
- Try a broader date range to verify events exist

#### Workflow runs very slowly
**Problem**: The workflow takes an extremely long time to complete

**Solutions**:
- Enable "Skip Map Generation" for large datasets
- Enable "Skip Attachment Download" if you don't need photos/documents
- Reduce the date range to smaller time periods
- Limit the number of event types selected
- Process data in smaller batches (by month or quarter)
- The first run may take longer as the environment gets warmed up. The following ones should be faster.

#### Authentication errors
**Problem**: Errors related to login or permissions

**Solutions**:
- Re-configure your EarthRanger data source in Ecoscope Desktop
- Verify your user account has permission to access event data in EarthRanger

#### Map won't generate
**Problem**: Data downloads successfully but no map is created

**Solutions**:
- Ensure "Skip Map Generation" is unchecked
- Verify your events have valid geometry/location data
- Try using default base map settings
